Ben Jonson said that his family originally came from the folk of the Anglo-Scottish
border country, which genealogy is verified by the three spindles (rhombi) in the
Jonson family coat of arms. One spindle is a diamond-shaped heraldic device shared
with the Border-country Johnstone family of Annandale.
